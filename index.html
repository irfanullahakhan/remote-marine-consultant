    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      A Master Mariner with over two decades of maritime expertise spanning seagoing command, port operations, HSE compliance, and technical marine consultancy. With a proven track record both at sea and in senior shore-based roles, I have supported shipping agents, shipowners, charterers, offshore operators, and regulatory authorities in delivering safe, compliant, and efficient maritime operations. Now working independently as a remote maritime consultant, I provide high-level technical advisory services entirely online—utilising secure digital tools, cloud-based platforms, and video conferencing to support global clients with precision and responsiveness.
    </p>
          My core competencies include ISM and MLC compliance audits, HSE risk assessments, procedural and SOP development, and digital vetting support in alignment with MARPOL, SOLAS, OCIMF/SIRE, and other leading international standards.
    <p>
          I hold a Certificate of Competency as Master (Class 1), an International Diploma in Safety Engineering (UK Level 6), a Master’s in Management Sciences, an MBA, and a BSc in Maritime Studies. 
      <p>
        
        This remote consultancy is built to help maritime stakeholders enhance safety performance, meet regulatory obligations, and optimise vessel and port operations,without the need for physical onboard attendance.
